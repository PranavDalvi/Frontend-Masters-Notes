# Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling

**Vertical Scaling (scaling up):**  Increase performance by adding more power (CPU, RAM, GPU, etc) to a machine.
- **Pros:**
	- Simple to implement
	- no code changes required
	- easier maintenance
- **Cons:**
	- Physical limits of hardware
	- Expensive to scale up/down
	- Decreased resiliency
- **Example:**
	- In AWS we change Instance size.
**Horizontal Scaling (scaling out):** Increase performance by adding more machines
- **Pros:**
	- Easily scales up/down with traffic
	- High availability
	- Increased fault tolerance
- **Cons:**
	- Requires orchestration (Added Complexity to manage)
	- Can require code changes
- Adding more machines

## Questions
1. **What is the primary limitation of vertical scaling in distributed systems?**
	1. Vertical scaling has a finite physical limit - there's only so much power, memory, and capacity that can be added to a single server. Technology and hardware have physical constraints on how powerful a single machine can become.
2. **What is a significant trade-off introduced by horizontal scaling?**
	1. Horizontal scaling introduces increased complexity and operational overhead. With multiple machines, you need orchestration systems to manage them all, which can require specialized software like Zookeeper or distributed messaging systems to handle the complexity of distributed systems.
3. **What is a key advantage of vertical scaling compared to horizontal scaling?**
	1. Vertical scaling is simpler because it requires no code changes and is easier to maintain. You can simply increase the instance size or add more resources to the existing server without modifying your application architecture.
4. **What resiliency issue arises when using vertical scaling with only a few large servers?**
	1. With vertical scaling and only a few large servers, if one server goes down, it represents a large portion of your total capacity. This creates a single point of failure risk, whereas horizontal scaling distributes the load across many servers, so losing one server has less impact.
