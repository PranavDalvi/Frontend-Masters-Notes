## Questions
1. **What is the purpose of HTTPS in system security, and why is it generally terminated at certain points rather than maintained throughout the entire request path?**
	1. HTTPS encrypts data during transit, like putting data in an armored car. It's generally terminated (decrypted) at certain points like load balancers because maintaining encryption throughout the entire path would be slow and unwieldy - every server along the way would have to inspect the encrypted data to see if it's for them. Termination requires a certificate to decrypt the traffic at that point.
2. **Why is encryption and decryption considered computationally expensive, and when might this become a performance concern?**
	1. All cryptography is computationally expensive by nature - that's why encryption algorithms like SHA-512 are difficult to break. While encryption/decryption costs are negligible at small scale, at millions of requests per second, the overhead of encrypting and decrypting can significantly slow down servers and become a performance bottleneck that needs to be addressed.
3. **What are three strategies for SSL/TLS termination in a distributed system?**
	1. Terminate at the load balancer or API gateway/reverse proxy — the most common approach. 
	2. Terminate at the application level, where the load balancer proxies the encrypted request all the way through to the service that actually needs it, which then decrypts it. This is used for highly sensitive data like HIPAA or financial transactions where the data must stay encrypted the entire way through. 
	3. Terminate at the load balancer, read the request, and let the load balancer decide whether to re-encrypt sensitive information before forwarding it or route it unencrypted — less common and computationally expensive.
4. **In what scenarios would you want to keep data encrypted throughout the entire request path until it reaches the final service, rather than terminating SSL/TLS at the load balancer?**
	1. When dealing with highly sensitive data that requires compliance (such as HIPAA for healthcare or financial/banking transactions), you should keep encryption throughout the entire path. This prevents any intermediate services along the way from reading the traffic, protecting against potential bad actors within the company who might access or modify the data. It ensures that only the final destination service can decrypt and read the sensitive information.
5. **What security risk do logging services pose in a system that terminates SSL/TLS early in the request path?**
	1. Logging services often make copies of requests, including their payloads. If SSL/TLS is terminated early and requests contain private or financial information, the log database will contain unencrypted sensitive data that most people can access. This creates a large exposed database of private information that shouldn't be there. Logs must be carefully cleaned to remove sensitive information like passwords and personal data.
