### Identify Requirements
- Core elements of system design
	- Translating business requirements.
	- Designing API and architecture.
	- Understanding technology and trade offs
- Building ToDo app: Question to be asked:
	- What core feature do we need to support
		- Strategy:
			- Scope the problem (how many user are going to use, is it a mobile app or web app, etc).
			- Design the high-level architecture
			- Address key challenges and trade-offs.
		- **Understanding the problem:**
			- Always ask question don't make assumptions
			- Functional Requirements: (what is the function, what the core of the app)
				- What are the requirements.
				- Functional requirements are 2 parts
					- **Functional:** Describe **<u>what</u>** the system should Do
					- **Non-Functional:** Describe **<u>how</u>** the system should perform.
				- What are the core features?
					- what should users be able to do?
				- Who are the users?
					- Are there different types of users?
				- How do users interact with the system?
					- What devices are supported
				- Are there edge cases to consider?
				- What are the constraints?
				- Is the application read heavy or write heavy (for CRUD based)
			- **Example:** Functional Req of Pizza shop
				- User should be able to view the menu of pizza and toppings.
				- User should be able to order a pizza.
				- User can only order 1 pizza at a time.
				- There is only 3 sizes of pizza.
				- A pizza can have at most 3 toppings.
- Questions:
	- What are the four main elements of good system design, in order of priority?
		- The four main elements are: 
		1) Translating business requirements, 
		2) Designing the API and architecture, 
		3) Handling edge cases and making trade-offs, and 
		4) Understanding the actual technology. Translating business requirements is the most crucial first step.
	- What is the difference between functional and non-functional requirements in system design?
		- Functional requirements describe what a system can do - the features, user interactions, and business requirements. Non-functional requirements describe how the system should perform - the quality attributes like speed, consistency, and performance trade-offs that constrain the system.
	- What is the recommended time allocation strategy for a one-hour system design interview?
		- The recommended allocation is: 10-15 minutes for scoping, 20-30 minutes for high-level architecture, and 15 minutes for trade-offs discussion. Scoping is the most important part and should not be rushed or skipped.
	- What are essential scoping questions to ask when designing a system?
		- Essential scoping questions include: How many users will use the system? Who are the users and what are their skill levels? What devices will users interact with? Are there different types of users with different permission levels? What are the core features versus nice-to-have features? What constraints is the system operating under?
