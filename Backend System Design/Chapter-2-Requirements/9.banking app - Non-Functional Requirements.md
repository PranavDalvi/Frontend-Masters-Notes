### Non-Functional Requirements (banking app)
- **Questions:**
	- How many MAUs (Monthly Active Users)?
	- How many transactions per user?
	- How frequent are the transactions?
	- How long do we store transaction data?
	- What is the minimum latency for a transaction?
	- What is our availability target?
	- How consistent are the traffic patterns?
	- How frequently do we back up data?
	- How long should it take to restore a backup?
	- What is the geolocation of  most our users?
	- Is there data/process compliance to be aware of?
	- What are the audit requirements
- **Non-Functional**
	- The system should have 4 nines of availability.
	- Transactions should be backed up daily.
	- Transaction data must be encrypted in transit and at rest.
	- Transactions cannot be lost.
	- Every transaction and user action must be audited.
### Questions (IMP Only)
1. **When designing a banking application, what are two key non-functional requirements related to data protection?**
	1. Transaction data must be encrypted both in transit and at rest. Additionally, there should be data process compliance requirements to protect PII (Personally Identifiable Information), which may include GDPR compliance depending on the region.
2. **What is the tradeoff when implementing end-to-end encryption for transaction data in a microservices architecture?**
	1. Normally, HTTPS traffic is decrypted at the edge to make processing faster and avoid computational overhead. However, if data must be encrypted in transit throughout the entire system until it reaches the database, every service must decrypt the data to use it, which is computationally expensive and impacts performance.
3. **Why are audit requirements considered a non-functional requirement in a banking application?**
	1. Audit requirements don't directly affect user-facing functionality, but they determine how the system tracks and logs who performed transactions and when they occurred. This is critical for recovering from issues like lost transactions or investigating fraud, but the user doesn't directly interact with these audit logs.
