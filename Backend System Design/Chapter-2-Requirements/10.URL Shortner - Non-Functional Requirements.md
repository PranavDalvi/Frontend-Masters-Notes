### Non-Functional Requirements (URL Shortner)
- **Questions:**
	- How many MAUs (Monthly Active Users)?
	- What is the average RPS (Response Per Second).
	- What is maximum latency allowed?
	- What is the maximum length of a URL?
	- Do URLs expire?
- **Non-Functional**
	- Redirects should happen in no more than 500 ms
	- System should support 1 million RPS.
	- Long URLs can be at most 3kb.
	- Short URLs can be at most 1kb.
### Questions (IMP Only)
1. **Why is setting a maximum URL size important when designing a URL shortener system?**
	- Setting a maximum URL size is important because it affects database choices and storage considerations. Without a limit, users could submit garbage data that could take down the system. Different databases have different limits - object databases have fewer restrictions while relational databases can have stricter limits.
2. **In a URL shortener system, why might hashing algorithm performance be a concern?**
	- Hashing algorithm performance matters because the URL shortener needs to perform look-ups quickly - it takes a short link, looks it up using a hash, and redirects to the corresponding long URL. The speed of both the hashing algorithm and the lookup operation impacts the overall response time of the redirect.
3. **Is URL expiration typically considered a functional or non-functional requirement in a URL shortener system, and why?**
	- URL expiration can be considered both functional and non-functional. It has functional aspects related to feature behaviour, but it also affects non-functional considerations like storage and system maintenance - if URLs don't expire, there needs to be a cleanup process, otherwise they will live on forever and impact storage capacity.
