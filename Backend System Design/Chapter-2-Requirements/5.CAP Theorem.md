### CAP Theorem
- The System should be:
	- Reliable
	- Availability
	- Resiliency (How well system handles failures)
	- Consistency (users sees the same data at the same time)
- CAP = Consistency, Availability and Partition Tolerance
	- **Consistency:** Every read receives the most recent write or error.
	- **Availability:** Every request receives a (non-error) response
	- **Partition Tolerance:** The system continues to operate even if messages are delayed or lost.
- But in Distributed Systems we can only get 2 of the 3 CAP only:

| Pick Two  | Trade Off                                              |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| ~~C + A~~ | ~~Only works without network issue~~                   |
| C + P     | Always show the latest data but unreliable performance |
| A + P     | Always responds but might show outdated data           |
