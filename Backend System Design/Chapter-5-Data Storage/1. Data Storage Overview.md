# Data Storage Overview
1. Use simplest solution (like SQL) we can scale-up later and make clear schema.
2. Data storage has 2 types **structured data** and **unstructured data**
	1. Structure data has relation between data like object oriented programming.
3. Persistent vs ephemeral (store it for limited amount of time)
4. read-optimised vs write-optimised
5. Consistency vs availability

| Relational                         | Non-Relational            |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| SQL                                | NoSQL                     |
| Structured data with relationships | Semi or unstructured data |
| Enforced schema                    | Flexible                  |
| ACID transactions                  | Horizontal scale          |

## Questions
1. **What are the two main types of data that determine database selection: one where data has a defined structure similar to object-oriented programming, and another where data might be stored as JSON blobs with varying fields?**
	1. Structured data and unstructured data. Structured data is used with relational databases and is similar to object-oriented programming with relationships between objects. Unstructured data is loosey-goosey, like JSON blobs with potentially overlapping fields, and is better suited for non-relational databases.
2. **What is the CAP theorem and what trade-off does it require in distributed systems?**
	1. CAP theorem stands for Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance. Since network failures (partitions) cannot be avoided, the theorem states that you must choose between Consistency and Availability - you cannot have both at the same time.
3. **What are examples of applications that should prioritize consistency over availability, and what are examples that should prioritize availability over consistency?**
	1. Applications requiring consistency include financial data and health records, where accurate data is critical. Applications prioritizing availability include social media platforms and air traffic control systems, where continuous access is more important than perfect consistency.
4. **What is the difference between persistent and ephemeral data storage, and when would each be appropriate?**
	1. Persistent data storage means data is written to disk and will be available when needed later. Ephemeral data storage means data is only stored temporarily, such as in memory variables on a machine. Ephemeral storage is appropriate for short-lived data, while persistent storage is needed for data that must survive system restarts.
5. **What are examples of write-heavy versus read-heavy applications, and what is the typical read-to-write ratio for most applications?**
	1. Write-heavy applications include logging systems, metric collection, and eventing systems. Read-heavy applications include npm (where most users download packages), social media (where users mostly scroll), and data warehouses. Most applications are read-heavy with ratios ranging from 10:1 to 1000:1 reads to writes.
