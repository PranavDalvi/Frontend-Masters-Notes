**In a cache-aside (lazy loading) caching strategy, what sequence of operations occurs when the server needs data?**
- In cache-aside strategy: 1) The server first checks the cache to see if the needed data exists, 2) If the data doesn't exist (cache miss), the server reads from the data store, 3) The cache is then updated with the retrieved data. This approach only caches data from actual real requests rather than caching everything.

**What is the key trade-off when using a write-behind caching strategy?**
- In write-behind caching, the application immediately writes to the cache and returns without waiting for the database write. The cache writes to the database asynchronously later. The advantage is much faster performance and higher availability. The trade-off is that consistency is not guaranteed, since the data may not have actually been written to the database when the application receives confirmation.

## Questions:
1. **What is the primary difference between a cache and a database in terms of data access and query complexity?**
	1. A cache is designed for fast access and uses a key-value store approach, without complex queries. It stores frequently accessed data as close as possible to the thing that needs that data. A database is typically further down the stack and supports complex queries, but is generally slower to access.
2. **What are the three main benefits of implementing caching in a system?**
	1. Caching provides three main benefits: 
		1) Reduced latency, which improves user experience, 
		2) Decreased system load by eliminating the need to make multiple hops to the database, and 
		3) Lower costs, since frequently accessed data can be retrieved from cache instead of performing expensive database lookups.
3. **What is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) and how does it use caching to improve performance?**
	1. A CDN is a form of caching that stores static assets as close to the user as possible. CDNs place content in distributed locations (sometimes in ISPs or data centers) around the world, reducing the number of network hops needed to retrieve content. This significantly reduces latency and improves user experience by serving content from nearby locations.
