# Caching Trade-offs & Invalidation 
- How we can prevent or refresh the stale data
## Cache Invalidation
- Time-base expiration (TTL)
- Event-based (function call)
- Version tagging (v1, v2 etc)
-  Refresh Ahead (schedule Update)
## Cache Eviction (how to Sort)
- FIFO: first in first out
- LIFO: Last in first out
- LRU: least recently used
- MRU: most recently used
- LFU: Least Frequently used
- RR: random replacement
## Questions:
1. What is the fundamental characteristic of a cache in relation to data storage?
	1. A cache is always a secondary representation of data, not the primary source. This creates an inherent tension between performance (speed) and data freshness (how up-to-date the data is).
2. What is TTL in the context of cache invalidation and how does it work?
	1. TTL stands for Time To Live. It's a cache invalidation mechanism that specifies a time frame (such as one minute, one hour, or any duration) after which the cached data is considered no longer valid and should be erased, regardless of what happens during that period.
3. What is the difference between cache invalidation and cache eviction?
	1. Cache invalidation is the process of marking data as no longer fresh or accurate, indicating it should not be used anymore. Cache eviction is the process of removing specific data from a cache when the cache is full and needs space for new data, deciding which existing data to remove based on a strategy.
4. What is the 'refresh ahead' cache invalidation strategy?
	1. Refresh ahead is a cache invalidation strategy where the system is designed to automatically update the cache periodically to keep the data current. In this approach, applications read from the cache while a background process continuously refreshes it with updated data.
5. What data structure is commonly used to implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache?
	1. A doubly linked list is the data structure commonly used to implement an LRU cache. This structure allows efficient tracking and removal of the least recently used items when the cache needs to evict data.
