# Estimations

- Help ground vague requirements in reality.
- Helps you think about the specifics of the system components.
- Shows the interviewer your thought process
- Don't have to be precise.

## Strategy
1. Clarify
	1. What are you estimation?
		1. users, request, storage
	2. Ask or make reasonable assumptions
		1. how many users etc
	3. Validate your assumptions
		1. Write it down!
2. Do the math
3. Sanity check your results

## Example:
How big will our tasks table get in a month if we have 100,00 users and a task is 500 bytes?

**Assumptions**
- 3 tasks per day
- 30 days in a month

**Calculations**
- Tasks per month `3 * 30 * 1000 = 90,000` tasks
- `90,000 * 500 bytes` = 45,000,000 bytes
- Convert to MB: 45,000,000 / 1,000,000 = 45 MB per month

## Questions
1. What is the primary purpose of doing estimations in system design?
	1. Estimations help determine if you're in the right ballpark for system requirements and help identify what needs to be measured (traffic patterns, users, RPS, storage). They provide a sanity check and help understand the most important aspects of the system, such as identifying bottlenecks. The goal is direction rather than precision.
2. What are the key types of metrics you should estimate when designing a system?
	1. The key metrics to estimate include: number of users, requests per second (RPS), and storage capacity needed. You should focus on estimating the most important thing that will become a bottleneck in your system, such as redirects for a URL shortener or database storage for a to-do app.
3. What is a reasonable maximum size for a single database before considering sharding or partitioning?
	1. Anything under 500 gigabytes provides a lot of margin for a single database. Around a terabyte, you might start thinking about sharding. Generally, if you're dealing with a couple hundred gigabytes, you're safe with a single database. The scale of terabytes per month would automatically suggest needing multiple databases.
4. When calculating storage requirements for a to-do app with 100,000 users, assuming 500 bytes per task, 3 tasks per day, and 30 days per month, approximately how much storage is needed per month?
	1. Using these assumptions: 100,000 users × 3 tasks/day × 30 days × 500 bytes = approximately 45 megabytes per month for 1,000 users, scaling to about 4 gigabytes per month for 100,000 users. This demonstrates that even at scale, the storage requirements are manageable for a single database.
5. What general rule should you know about data access speeds when doing system design estimations?
	1. You should know that in-memory storage is faster than disk, and cache is faster than database. While you don't need to memorize precise timings for L1 cache, L2 cache, or exact lookup times, understanding these relative speed relationships is sufficient for making reasonable system design decisions.
