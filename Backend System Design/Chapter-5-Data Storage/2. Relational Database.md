# Relational Database
- Mostly scale vertically.

- They are ACID compliance
	- **Atomicity**: Each transactions is all-or-nothing. Either every operation succeeds, or none do.
	- **Consistent**: Transactions always follows the rules set for the database.
	- **Isolated**: Concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other. Each runs as if it were alone
	- **Durable**: Once a transaction is saved its changes are permanent.

### Questions
1. **When comparing relational and non-relational databases, which type is better suited for situations requiring strict, consistent data storage schemas?**
	1. Relational databases are better suited for strict, consistent data storage schemes. They provide stronger guarantees about data integrity and consistency, though the cost of fixing an incorrect schema is very expensive if discovered later.
2. **What is the difference between horizontal and vertical scaling in the context of databases, and how do relational databases typically scale?**
	1. Horizontal scaling is like adding multiple ovens, while vertical scaling is like getting a bigger oven. Relational databases can only scale vertically - they have to get bigger rather than automatically distributing across multiple servers. This is primarily due to their transactional nature, which makes it difficult to load balance without creating conflicts.
3. **Why do relational databases excel at complex queries compared to non-relational databases?**
	1. Relational databases can perform complex queries quickly because the data is structured with clear relationships. The database knows exactly where data is located and which column it's in, allowing for very fast extraction. In contrast, non-relational databases with unstructured data must search field by field, making queries slower.
4. **What is denormalization in the context of non-relational databases, and why might it be used?**
	1. Denormalization is the practice of duplicating data rather than spreading it across multiple relations (the opposite of normalization). In non-relational databases like MongoDB, denormalization is often used to optimize read performance by putting everything in one document, though this must be balanced against document size limits (such as MongoDB's 16 megabit limit).
