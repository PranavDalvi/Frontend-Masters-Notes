## Protocols
## 1. HTTP (Hyper Text Transport Protocol)
### Key Characteristics
- Simple
- Human readable
- Supported by all browsers
- Stateless
### Common Use Cases
- Web browsers
***
## 2. WebSockets
### Key Characteristics
- Bi-directional Communication
- Persistent Connection
- low-latency
- stateful
### Common use cases
- Chat Application
- Live dashboards
- Collaborative editing
### Cons
- Heavy on resource to the connection alive (constant pings)
***
## 3. Server-Sent Events
### Key Characteristics
- One-way communication (server to client)
- Human Readable
### Common use cases
- News feeds
- status updates
- stock tickers
***
## 4. gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)
### Key Characteristics
- Binary protocol (HTTP/2)
- Strongly-typed contracts (protocol buffers)
- Requires code generation
### Common use cases
- Microservice communication
- Performance critical systems
- IoT devices
***
## 5. REST (REpresentational State Transfer)
### Key Characteristics
- Multiple endpoints
- Human readable
- Supported by all browsers
- Stateless
### Common use cases
- Single-source of data
- CRUD apps
- easily cached data
***
## 6. GraphQL (Graph Query Language)
### Key Characteristics
- Single endpoint
- Precise data retrieval
- Self-documenting API
- Strongly typed
### Common use cases
- Complex or multiple sources of data (Facebook Homepage)
- Apps supporting multiple client types
- Decoupling frontend from backend development

## Questions
1. **Why is gRPC typically not used for browser-to-backend communication?**
	1. Browsers don't support gRPC natively, requiring a library to interpret it. Additionally, it only works over HTTP/2 and uses protocol buffers which are not human-readable, making it better suited for service-to-service communication.
2. **What is a primary advantage of GraphQL over REST when dealing with multiple data sources?**
	1. GraphQL can fetch data from multiple sources (like news feeds, pictures, and ads) and make it look like one endpoint, whereas REST would require multiple separate calls to different endpoints.
