### Questions
1. **When designing a system with a simple API, what is the relationship between functional requirements, nonfunctional requirements, and API design?**
	1. APIs should be a literal translation of business requirements into code. If you can successfully convert functional and nonfunctional requirements into an API, most of the work is already done for a simple application.
2. **What is an important consideration when deciding whether to create separate endpoints for different operations versus combining them?**
	1. Consider the complexity and expense of the operation. For example, an expensive calculation like comparing multiple stock ticker symbols would warrant a separate endpoint rather than lumping it together with other operations.
3. **When designing a system, what principle should guide your choice between simple and complex solutions?**
	1. You should focus on what's the simplest, cheapest thing you can do, rather than automatically choosing the most rigorous or over-engineered solution. Avoid unnecessary complexity when a simpler approach will suffice.
4. **What is the benefit of explicitly listing out all endpoints when designing an API?**
	1. Listing out endpoints helps visualize the actual scope of the system. It can reveal that complex functional requirements may boil down to just a few endpoints, making the system easier to reason about and understand.
5. **In API design, when might you avoid using a more sophisticated solution like GraphQL?**
	1. When the API is simple enough that it doesn't merit the added complexity. If the system only requires a few straightforward endpoints, a simpler REST-based approach may be more appropriate than introducing GraphQL.
