# Protocol Scenarios
### Case Studies
1. **A stock trading dashboard showing real-time price updates.**
	1. We can use Server-Sent Protocol.
2. **A document editor where multiple users collaborate simultaneously.**
	1. We can use Web Socket Protocol.
3. **A food delivery app that needs to show the delivery driver's location.**
	1. Web sockets are expensive to maintain so here we can use HTTP Protocol with long polling
4. **An API for a banking system used by multiple client applications.**
	1. We can use REST
5. **Communication between microservices in a video processing pipeline.**
	1. gRPC

### Questions
1. **What is a significant downside of using WebSockets on mobile devices?**
	1. WebSockets consume battery life quickly on mobile devices because they constantly ping the backend to keep the connection alive and perform handshakes. HTTP long polling can be a better middle ground solution for mobile applications.
2. **For a food delivery app showing driver location, what factors determine the choice between HTTP polling and WebSockets?**
	1. The choice depends on update frequency requirements and the directionality of communication. If updates don't need to happen very often, standard HTTP polling every couple of seconds is sufficient. For very frequent updates, WebSockets may be necessary. Additionally, the write operations (driver sending location) could use HTTP, while read operations (user viewing location) could use Server-Sent Events.
